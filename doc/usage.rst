Usage
=====

Basic
-----
The basic use case is::

 # this will load libdiscid
 import discid

 print("device: %s" % discid.get_default_device())
 disc = discid.read()        # reads from default device
 print("id: %s" % disc.id)
 print("submission url:\n%s" % disc.submission_url)

You can also set the device explicitely::

 device = discid.get_default_device()
 disc = discid.read(device)
 id = disc.id

You can use other devices of course: see :func:`read`.

When anything goes wrong reading from the device, :exc:`DiscError` is raised.

Advanced
--------
:mod:`discid` can do more than just provide the MusicBrainz Disc ID.
You can get details about the tracks an fetch additional features
like the ISRCs and the MCN, which is basically the EAN/UPC of the disc::

 disc = discid.read(features=["mcn", "isrc"])
 print("mcn: %s" % disc.mcn)
 for track in disc.tracks:
     print("{num:>2}: {isrc:13}".format(num=track.number, isrc=track.isrc))

Without Disc Access
-------------------
When you just want to generate disc IDs and you have the necessary data
laying around, you can use :func:`put`.
You will need the numbers of the first track (should be 1),
the number of the last audio track (cut off trailing data tracks),
the total number of sectors for these tracks
and the offset for every one of the tracks up to the last audio track.

An example for the TOC
`TqvKjMu7dMliSfmVEBtrL7sBSno- <http://musicbrainz.org/cdtoc/TqvKjMu7dMliSfmVEBtrL7sBSno->`_::

 first = 1
 last = 15
 sectors = 258725
 offsets = [150, 17510, ..., 235590]
 disc = discid.put(first, last, sectors, offsets)
 print("id: %s" % disc.id)
 last_track = disc.tracks[disc.last_track_num - 1]
 print("last track length: %s seconds" % last_track.seconds)

.. note:: The example disc has track 16 as a multimedia/data track.
   The sector count for the disc is the ending sector for track 15!
   Depending on how you get this number, you might need to substract
   11400 (2:32 minutes) from your sector count.
   Make sure the last track length is correct!

   on which numbers to choose.

Fetching Metadata
-----------------
You can use `python-musicbrainz-ngs`_ to fetch metadata for your disc.
The relevant function is :func:`musicbrainzngs.get_releases_by_discid`::

 import discid
 import musicbrainzngs

 musicbrainzngs.set_useragent("python-discid-example", "0.1", "your@mail")

 disc = discid.read()
 try:
     result = musicbrainzngs.get_releases_by_discid(disc.id,
                                                    includes=["artists"])
 except musicbrainzngs.ResponseError:
     print("disc not found or bad response")
 else:
     if result.get("disc"):
         print("artist:\t%s" %
               result["disc"]["release-list"][0]["artist-credit-phrase"])
         print("title:\t%s" % result["disc"]["release-list"][0]["title"])
     elif result.get("cdstub"):
         print("artist:\t" % result["cdstub"]["artist"])
         print("title:\t" % result["cdstub"]["title"])

You can fetch much more data.
See :mod:`musicbrainzngs` for details.

.. note:: Please submit your disc ID with :attr:`Disc.submission_url`
   when it isn't found at the MusicBrainz server.
