Libdiscid Python bindings
-------------------------

**important note**:
The API is still in development and might change until 1.0.0!

Python-discid implements Python bindings for MusicBrainz Libdiscid. This
module works with Python 2 >= 2.6, or Python 3 >= 3.1.
Libdiscid >= 0.2.2 is needed.

Libdiscid's main purpose is the calculation of an identifier of audio
discs (disc id) to use for the MusicBrainz database.

That identifier is calculated from the TOC of the disc, similar to the
freeDB CDDB identifier. Libdiscid can calculate MusicBranz Disc IDs and
freeDB Disc IDs.

This module is a very close binding that offloads all relevant data
storage and calculation to Libdiscid. On the other hand it gives a
pythonic API and uses an object and exceptions.

For more information on Libdiscid see `libdiscid`_.

For more information about the calculation of these disc ids see `Disc
ID Calculation`_.

Usage
~~~~~

::

    # this will load Libdiscid
    import discid

    disc = discid.read("/dev/cdrom")
    print "id: %s" % disc.id  # Python 2
    print("id: %s" % disc.id) # Python 3

- The API is incomplete.
  I will complete it when the base API is decided and stable.

For other things you can submit tickets at `Github`_.
The API is still subject to change.
